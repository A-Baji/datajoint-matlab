DataJoint for MATLAB is a high-level programming interface to MySQL databases. It was designed by Dimitri Yatsenko in [Andreas Tolias' Lab](toliaslab.org) for the distributed processing and management of large volumes of data in a science lab. DataJoint is built on the foundation of the relational data model and prescribes a consistent method for organizing, populating, and querying data.
